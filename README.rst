jinja2_s3loader: A Jinja2 template loader for AWS S3.
==============================================================

**Project Status:** Beta. It's pretty simple and works for me, but not heavily
tested in production use. Caveat Emptor.

Usage
--------------------------------

This library relies on the `boto3`_ library for S3 access, so you will need to
`configure your AWS credentials`_ first. Then, provide your S3 bucket name and
optional template directory name when instantiating the loader::

    #!python
    from jinja2 import Environment
    from jinja2_s3loader import S3loader

    s3template_dir = "test/templates"  # trailing slash not required, but ok
    j2 = Environment(loader=S3loader('my-s3-bucket-name', s3template_dir))
    t = j2.get_template('mytemplate.j2')  # loads test/templates/mytemplate.j2
    print(t.render({}))

.. _boto3: https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html
.. _configure your AWS credentials: https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/configuration.html

Note that, although S3 does not have real directories and treats the prefix
string as purely a sub-string, this S3loader will treat the prefix as a
subdirectory. That is, it will add a trailing slash if none is provided.

Remember, accessing files over S3 costs money. The loader currently does not
support live reloading. I built this to support accessing S3 templates from AWS
Lambda functions, so those constraints are fine with me, but your use case may
be different. 

Contributions welcome. File a Github issue to report a bug.

Known Issues
--------------------------------
* The loader blindly attempts to decode all templates as UTF-8. If your template
  is encoded with an incompatible encoding, it WILL be broken. PR's welcome.
